        Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's creation of the first
        internal combustion engine in a car, seen in the Benz Patent Motorwagen
        – financed by Bertha Benz's dowry[10] and patented in January 1886[11] –
        and Gottlieb Daimler and their engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of
        a stagecoach, with the addition of a petrol engine, introduced later
        that year. The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by Daimler
        Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG).
